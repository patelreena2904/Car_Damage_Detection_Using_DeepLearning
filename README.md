# Car_Damage_Detection_Using_DeepLearning

Project Overview
This project is an AI-based Car Damage Classification System built using PyTorch, ResNet50, Optuna, Streamlit, and FastAPI. It detects the type of car damage from an uploaded image.

Dataset
Images: 2300
Class labels: "Front Breakage",'Front Crushed','Front Normal','Rear Breakage','Rear Crushed','Rear Normal'
Features / Preprocessing
✅ Deep Learning model (ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet)

✅ Fine-tuned last layers + hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

✅ Image augmentations for better generalization

✅ Streamlit Web App for easy image upload & prediction

✅ FastAPI endpoint for programmatic inference

✅ Supports 6 classes of car damage

✅ Achieved ~80% accuracy

Modeling
Models: Base: ResNet50 (pretrained) Frozen: All layers except layer4
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using Optuna, tuned:Learning rate (1e−5 to 1e−2) and Dropout rate (0.2 to 0.7)
Streamlit App
Built an interactive frontend using Streamlit

it varies much from running it locally. Need further improvement.
Installation
Clone the repository:
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
